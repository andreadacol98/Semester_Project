Abstract: High mobility, on-demand and fast deployment are all reasons why robotic swarms are increasingly employed in a variety of real world applications, ranging from area mapping, inspection, search and rescue to wireless communications. Specifically, in wireless networks, autonomous robots (e.g., UAVs, quadcopters, etc.) are typically used to complement existing communication infrastructures that experience heavy traffic conditions, or to enable robust, reliable communication links between distant users with no direct wireless connection, in emergency situations. However, the establishment of a reliable and efficient swarm-enabled communication infrastructure must face some intrinsic challenges that arise when working in wireless settings, namely non-ideal signal propagation and limited range of communication. These are important factors in the control of multi-agent systems, since exchange of local information happens through such non-ideal communication channels. Motivated by recent results in feedback-based optimization and equilibrium-seeking control, we design a distributed, scalable and robust control strategy for real-time communication-aware path planning for multi-agent systems in wireless networks. Test cases involving two and three-dimensional robotic formations are provided in order to assess performance of the proposed control paradigm.
